# Auth Service Clean Build Risk Assessment

## Risk Level: LOW

### Dependencies Risk: LOW
- Simple dependency set (FastAPI, gRPC, Prisma, Pydantic)
- Well-documented in pyproject.toml and requirements.txt
- No complex external integrations

### Configuration Risk: LOW  
- Standard Python service configuration
- Clear Dockerfile structure
- Minimal environment variables

### Functionality Risk: LOW
- JWT token management is stateless
- No complex business logic
- Well-defined gRPC interface

### Integration Risk: LOW
- Used by other services but not critical for core FAQ functionality
- Clear rollback path if issues occur
- No cascading failure risk

### Build Complexity Risk: LOW
- Standard Python/Poetry build process
- No special build requirements
- Fast build time expected

## Critical Dependencies:
- postgres (database) - ALREADY RUNNING
- Basic environment variables for JWT secrets

## Potential Issues:
1. JWT secret configuration
2. Database connection string
3. gRPC port conflicts

## Mitigation Plan:
1. Backup current container state
2. Test with current environment variables
3. Validate JWT functionality post-build
4. Keep current container running until validation complete

## Success Criteria:
- Service starts without errors
- Health endpoint returns 200
- JWT token generation/validation works
- gRPC endpoint responds to health checks
